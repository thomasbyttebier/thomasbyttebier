Time for a new chapter.

After 10 years as Digital Director at Base Design, I’ve decided to start something of my own.

It’s called Uncommon Practice.

A digital experience studio. But different. Questioning current formats, standards, and methods. Aiming for work that’s unusual but authentic. And future-facing.

We work across web, AI, and the intersection of physical and digital. Storytelling, experience strategy, innovation strategy, design, development.

I’ll be working closely with brands and cultural institutions, building teams of experts shaped by the project’s idea, not by an org chart.

It’s early days. Still taking shape.
But the direction feels right. And I’m excited.

If this sparks something, let’s talk.

Onwards!

Sorry for neglecting my blog. Work kept me busy. But today I have an announcement.

Decided to wrap up a big chapter. 
10 years at [Base](https://basedesign.com). 
It’s been a ride!
Joined as a web designer,
leaving as Digital Director.

Starting July, it’s time for something new. 
Not sure exactly what that will be. 
Keeping my mind open to anything. 

But definitely in the exciting space of brand, new tech, great design.
Hitting the sweet spot between the obvious and the unseen.
Never the gimmick.

Thank you Base Design, for your trust. 
Grateful to the amazing people, the many clients; many sectors. 
Learned so much!

excerpt: Building a new creative studio takes time.
---

No deadlines.  
No Slack messages.  
Very few emails.  
A quiet calendar.  
No direct pressure.

OMG such a change!

A month ago, this would’ve felt like a dream scenario.
But now? Surprisingly… uncomfortable.

And of course I know it’s all normal. Building a new creative studio takes time. And in many ways, it’s been a calculated choice. 

But you can’t plan everything. I never anticipated the space to be filled by this tiny voice in my head asking: “Is this really normal? Am I doing enough? Was this the right choice? What matters most?”

So far I have been talking to people mostly. (Thank you all!) No agenda, no pitch, just open conversations. There’s no roadmap yet, but the questions are helping things take shape.

I’ve also been thinking. (Too much?) Trying to put words to what I’m building.
Figuring out how to describe what I do. Who it’s for. Why it matters. What’s the mental image I want people to hold...

Been doing this for years for clients, but doing it for myself is harder than expected. But then again also more energizing than expected.

Anyway… days of many highs and many lows. 
If you’ve been through this phase, I’d love to hear how you navigated it.

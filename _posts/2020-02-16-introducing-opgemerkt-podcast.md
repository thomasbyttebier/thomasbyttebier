A quick note to let you know I am now hosting a podcast (in Dutch) together with [Stef Hamerlinck](http://stefhamerlinck.be). It is called [Opgemerkt](https://opgemerkt.simplecast.com/).

I did some attempts to podcasting before, but never felt comfortable releasing anything. This time however it feels right. It's good to finally discover the other side of the medium.

The plan is to release a weekly episode on Tuesdays. Stef and me discuss one or two topics that caught our eye in the world of branding, communication, design or digital. This format allows me to learn something remarkable each week from Stef, and I hope the same can be said from his side.

We don't do edits and we don't prepare extensively. Above all it has to stay fun, spontaneous and quick to release. We aim for 25 minute episodes. From my own experience listening to podcasts, this is the perfect length.

You can subscribe on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/be/podcast/opgemerkt/id1496559514?l=nl&i=1000465229575), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/5cDsraxmbx7B0B33O1xz5L?si=WipTG2yJQOu0tQIT-v5wxw) or any other popular podcasting channel. There is also [a web link to the podcast](https://opgemerkt.simplecast.com). We're also on [Twitter as Opgemerkt](https://twitter.com/opgemerktpod).

All feedback is welcome.

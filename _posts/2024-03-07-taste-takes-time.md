(This article was issue 17 of Maps, a newsletter on Digital I co-wrote for Base Design from 2022 to 2025.)

First, mankind.

Then, computers.  
Graphical User Interfaces.  
The World Wide Web.  
Web 2.0 and social media.  
The iPhone.  
Web 3.  

And now: Artificial Intelligence.

AI is changing it all again.  
Literally everything.  
In the most profound ways.  

And it’s only the beginning.  
As tools improve and become more accessible, it makes all of us question how we work. And where to strategically focus.

Of course I made the reflection myself as well. Haven’t we all? As creatives, what will be our roles in the future? And how will your job evolve?

Well, I’m terribly sorry.  
I don’t have the answer.

But I do see clues. 

For instance that AI is really good at technical tasks with a clearly defined brief. Like:  
- Rewrite this article in under 100 words.
- Make this song ten seconds longer before the chorus.
- Make a landscape video out of this portrait one, without cropping.
- Generate an image of a cyber-punk jellyfish.

And that AI is pretty terrible at coming up with anything that is:
- Strategically smart
- Very contemporary 
- Emotionally sophisticated
- Perfectly executed
- Showing excellent taste

In a [great article](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/elizabeth-goodspeed-column-taste-technology-art-280224), Elizabeth Goodspeed is making exactly that last point: “AI does not have taste”. 

I agree. And it most likely never will.

It’s always humans who provide context, and judge with taste. The outcome of AI fully depends on the creative ambitions of those who use it.

So… back to our original question. Where to move our focus in the AI-age? Well, one thing is clear: good taste will be everything.

That should at least give us enough guidance to figure out where to go next. 

Now you may ask: how to acquire taste? Hmm… that’s a big one. Elizabeth writes: “Good taste takes time”.

But maybe that’s more of a subject for our next issue :)

Eric reasons that images aren’t necessarily created, they’re discovered.
